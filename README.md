# HLTV-dashboard – Power BI 
## Project Overview 

This project involves a data visualization dashboard (3 pages) built to analyze statistics and performance metrics from Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) esports events.
The dashboard is built on processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) scraped from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the HLTV-scraper repository: [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper).

### Purpose
- Analyze team and player performance across tournaments and maps.
- Identify top-performing players, teams, and map-specific trends.
- Enable quick insights through interactive visualizations, filtering by match, map, team, or player.

### Data Model
- **Matches_data** table → match-level statistics (teams, scores, dates, maps).  
- **Players_data** table → player-level statistics (K-D, +/- score, ADR, Swing, Rating 3.0).  
- **Maps** table → added to support map-based analysis and filtering.
- **Teams** table → added to create a measure for counting the number of teams.

## Data Source

The Power BI dashboards use the processed data stored in the Excel file: **`Tournament_Data_Tables.xlsx`** with 2 sheets:
- **Sheet `matches_data`** 
- **Sheet `players_data`** 

The source data in this Excel file is generated by the **HLTV-scraper** repository [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper) 
All match and player stats are scraped directly from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the Python scripts described in the HLTV-scraper repository.

The processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) were further transformed in Power BI for visualization and analysis.  
An additional **Map** table was created to enrich the data model and enable map-based analysis. Also **Teams** table was created to use a measure counting the number of teams participating in the tournaments.

## Dashboard Pages (Tournament_Analysis.pbix)
The dashboard contains 3 pages with different insights: `Overall Insights`, `Players Insights` and `Teams Insights`.

### Data Filters
The dashboard includes interactive filters to customize the view:
*   **Event:** 
*   **Team:** 
*   **Player:** 
*   **Map:**
  
On the `Players Insights` and `Teams Insights` pages, the **Maps** filter has an additional `All maps` option, which provides values for entire matches (bo3 and bo5), rather than just for one single map.

### 1. **Overall Insights**
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of event data, including team and player performance by country, map popularity, and participant information.

#### Data Visualizations


### 1. Rating 3.0 by Country
This horizontal bar chart ranks countries by their average player performance rating (where ~1.0 is considered average). The visualization shows only countries that have 3 or more players.

**Top Countries:**
*   **Russia:** ~1.15
*   **Mongolia:** ~1.13
etc.

### 2. Matches per Map
This horizontal bar chart displays the number of competitive matches played on various CS2 maps, indicating map popularity and usage in the analyzed events.

**Top Maps:**
*   **Mirage:** 25 matches
*   **Inferno:** 23 matches
*   **Nuke:** 23 matches
*   **Ancient:** 18 matches
etc.

### 2. Cards
*   **Teams:** 18 - total teams that participate in the events
*   **Matches** 52 - total matches that have been played in the events
*   **Matches** 123 - total maps that have been played in the events
*   **Matches** Mirage - most played map in the events



2. **Players Insights**
   - Player-level statistics including K-D, ADR, Swing, and Rating 3.0.
   - Comparative analysis across players, teams, and maps.
   - Highlights top performers and consistency metrics.

3. **Teams Insights**
   - Aggregated team statistics and head-to-head comparisons.
   - Trends in performance across different events and maps.
   - Insights into team strengths, weaknesses, and overall rating distributions.
