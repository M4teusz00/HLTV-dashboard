## HLTV-dashboard
## Project Overview – Power BI Dashboard

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring competitive Counter-Strike match data.  
The dashboard is built on processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) scraped from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the HLTV-scraper repository: [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper).

### Purpose
- Analyze team and player performance across tournaments and maps.
- Identify top-performing players, teams, and map-specific trends.
- Enable quick insights through interactive visualizations, filtering by match, map, team, or player.

### Data Model
- **matches_data** → match-level statistics (teams, scores, dates, maps).  
- **players_data** → player-level statistics (K-D, +/- score, ADR, Swing, Rating 3.0).  
- **Map table** → added to support map-based analysis and filtering.
- **Teams table** → added to create a measure for counting the number of teams.

## Data Source

The Power BI dashboards use the processed data stored in the Excel file:

**`Tournament_Data_Tables.xlsx`**  
- **Sheet `matches_data`** → match-level statistics, including teams, scores, dates, and maps.  
- **Sheet `players_data`** → player-level statistics, including K-D, +/- score, ADR, Swing, and Rating 3.0.

The source data in this Excel file is generated by the **HLTV-scraper** repository in this project.  
All match and player stats are scraped directly from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the Python scripts described above.

The processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) were further transformed in Power BI for visualization and analysis.  
An additional **Map table** was created to enrich the data model and enable map-based analysis.
