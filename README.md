# HLTV-dashboard – Power BI 
## Project Overview 

This project involves a data visualization dashboard (3 pages) built to analyze statistics and performance metrics from Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) esports events.
The dashboard is built on processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) scraped from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the HLTV-scraper repository: [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper).

### Purpose
- Analyze team and player performance across tournaments and maps.
- Identify top-performing players, teams, and map-specific trends.
- Enable quick insights through interactive visualizations, filtering by match, map, team, or player.

### Data Model
- **Matches_data** table → match-level statistics (teams, scores, dates, maps).  
- **Players_data** table → player-level statistics (K-D, +/- score, ADR, Swing, Rating 3.0).  
- **Maps** table → added to support map-based analysis and filtering.
- **Teams** table → added to create a measure for counting the number of teams.

## Data Source

The Power BI dashboards use the processed data stored in the Excel file: **`Tournament_Data_Tables.xlsx`** with 2 sheets:
- **Sheet `matches_data`** 
- **Sheet `players_data`** 

The source data in this Excel file is generated by the **HLTV-scraper** repository [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper) 
All match and player stats are scraped directly from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the Python scripts described in the HLTV-scraper repository.

The processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) were further transformed in Power BI for visualization and analysis.  
An additional **Map** table was created to enrich the data model and enable map-based analysis. Also **Teams** table was created to use a measure counting the number of teams participating in the tournaments.

## Dashboard Pages (Tournament_Analysis.pbix)
The dashboard contains 3 pages with different insights: `Overall Insights`, `Players Insights` and `Teams Insights`.

### Data Filters
The dashboard includes interactive filters to customize the view:
*   **Event:** 
*   **Team:** 
*   **Player:** 
*   **Map:**
  
On the `Players Insights` and `Teams Insights` pages, the **Maps** filter has an additional `All maps` option, which provides values for entire matches (bo3 and bo5), rather than just for one single map.

### 1. **Overall Insights**
The first page provides an overall view of event data, including playerw performance by country, map popularity, and participant information.

#### Overall Insights Page:

#### Visualizations:

1. **Rating 3.0 by Country**
This horizontal bar chart ranks countries by their average player performance rating (where ~1.0 is considered average). The visualization shows only countries that have 3 or more players.
**Top Countries:**
*   **Russia:** ~1.15
*   **Mongolia:** ~1.13
etc.
2. **Matches per Map**
This horizontal bar chart displays the number of competitive matches played on various CS2 maps, indicating map popularity and usage in the analyzed events.
**Top Maps:**
*   **Mirage:** 25 matches
*   **Inferno:** 23 matches
*   **Nuke:** 23 matches
*   **Ancient:** 18 matches
etc.
3. **Cards**
*   **Teams:** 18 - total teams that participate in the events
*   **Matches** 52 - total matches that have been played in the events
*   **Matches** 123 - total maps that have been played in the events
*   **Matches** Mirage - most played map in the events
4. **Map**
A world map shows the geographic origin (country) of all participating players.

### 2. **Players Insights**
This page of the dashboard is dedicated to analyzing player performance through two key metrics: ADR (Average Damage per Round) and Rating 3.0 (a comprehensive performance rating). It presents this data through ranked lists and a detailed table for comparison.
     
#### Players Insights Page:

#### Metrics Featured:
*   **ADR (Average Damage per Round):** Measures the average amount of damage a player inflicts per round.
*   **Rating 3.0:** A holistic performance rating that incorporates kills, deaths, multi-kills, and clutch situations.
*   **K/D Ratio:** Kill-to-Death ratio, indicating fragging efficiency.
*   **Swing (Impact):** A metric likely quantifying a player's ability to win rounds through multi-kills and clutches.

#### Visualizations:
1.  **Highest ADR Players:** A ranked list of the top 8 players by ADR, led by `donk` (101,5).
2.  **Lowest ADR Players:** A ranked list of the 9 players with the lowest ADR values.
3.  **Scatter Plot (Player Rating 3.0 vs ADR):**
    *   **X-Axis:** ADR (Average Damage per Round)
    *   **Y-Axis:** Rating 3.0
    *   **Shows:** The strong positive correlation between damage dealt and overall rating. Each point is a player.
4.  **Clustered Bar Chart (Total Kills/Deaths):**
    *   **Bars** 2 bars for each player.
    *   **Shows:** The total number of Kills and Deaths and the balance between them. A green bar represents kills, and red represents deaths.
5.  **Performance Comparison Table:** A detailed table for players comparing Rating 3.0, ADR, K/D Ratio, and Impact. This table shows a strong correlation between high ADR and a high overall rating.
