# HLTV-dashboard – Power BI 
## Project Overview 

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard for exploring competitive Counter-Strike match data.  
The dashboard is built on processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) scraped from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the HLTV-scraper repository: [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper).

### Purpose
- Analyze team and player performance across tournaments and maps.
- Identify top-performing players, teams, and map-specific trends.
- Enable quick insights through interactive visualizations, filtering by match, map, team, or player.

### Data Model
- **Matches_data** table → match-level statistics (teams, scores, dates, maps).  
- **Players_data** table → player-level statistics (K-D, +/- score, ADR, Swing, Rating 3.0).  
- **Maps** table → added to support map-based analysis and filtering.
- **Teams** table → added to create a measure for counting the number of teams.

## Data Source

The Power BI dashboards use the processed data stored in the Excel file: **`Tournament_Data_Tables.xlsx`** with 2 sheets:
- **Sheet `matches_data`** 
- **Sheet `players_data`** 

The source data in this Excel file is generated by the **HLTV-scraper** repository [HLTV Scraper](https://github.com/M4teusz00/HLTV-scraper) 
All match and player stats are scraped directly from [HLTV.org](https://www.hltv.org) using the Python scripts described in the HLTV-scraper repository.

The processed datasets (`matches_data` and `players_data`) were further transformed in Power BI for visualization and analysis.  
An additional **Map** table was created to enrich the data model and enable map-based analysis. Also **Teams** table was created to use a measure counting the number of teams participating in the tournaments.
